Spotify Web Player Clone
HTML, CSS, Font Awesome, Google Fonts
Developed a responsive front-end clone of the Spotify web player,
featuring a modern UI with sidebar navigation, sticky header, music cards, and a mock music player. 
Implemented sections like “Recently Played,” “Trending Near You,” and “Featured Charts” using reusable card components. 
Used external icon libraries and custom fonts to closely replicate Spotify’s user interface.
Focused on clean layout, responsive design, and user-friendly navigation to demonstrate proficiency in web design and front-end development.
